# Auto-Refresh-Webcam-Live-with-Photo
This script can be used for all those weather webcams that send a photo inside a folder on web hosting. The script fetches the most recent photo in the folder every 5 seconds and updates it without needing to reload the whole web page.  What you have to do is replace the folder in the code (webcam/) with yours, upload to the hosting and it works.
